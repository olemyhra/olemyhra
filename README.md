### Hi there 👋

My name is Ole Myhra and I am a hobby developer from Norway.

I have a passion for software development and focus mostly on C programming in general but also doing some embedded systems work.

My goal is to expand my knowledge about the C programming language but also learn about doing test driven development and using a common build environment like cmake.

Best regards Ole Myhra
