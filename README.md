### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ole Myhra and I am a hobby developer from Norway.

I have a passion for software development and focus mostly on C programming in general but also doing some embedded systems work.

My main project these days is to develop an emulator for the Atmel ATtiny85 micro controller. The intention with this project is to expand my knowledge about the C programming language but also learn about doing test driven development and using a common build environment using cmake.

Best regards Ole Myhra
